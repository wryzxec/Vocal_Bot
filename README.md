This can eventually be incorporated into Amadeus, which is why I want to work on it.

Current problems:
* Text generation is slow
* Voice generation is slow

Proposed changes:
* Local TTV
* Try local LLM, but probably would be slower depending on what machine you have. Make that an option (compare local specs against openai benchmarks then pick the better one)
